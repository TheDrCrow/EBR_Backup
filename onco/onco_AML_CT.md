# AML. The role of CT

## CT C/A/P is used frequently for 'staging' for AML in WSHT.

**Why?** Not obviously in any guidelines and the staging systems do not include either assessment of stage nor grade based on CT findings nor assessment of response. [^vanZuuren2018]

> 'Well it allows us to separate those who we will be sending for autograft and those who we will not be.

> 'Started as a chest to make sure there is nothing lurking due to the immunosuppression and dangers from the induction chemo'

So, seems like a 'wunscherfullung' expansion into the 'global prognostics' domain. 

Will demonstrate other pathologies which can lead to confusion, delay and potential mis or delayed treatment. ( Case with confusion over lytic lesions ?? myeloma needing WBMRI after a CT body )

### Diagnosis and Staging

### Treatment

### Evidence about role and Efficacy of CT in AML.

Nil that I can find about role of CT.

Nil in the BSH about this. Only AML in pregnancy. [^BSH2021]

[^BSH2021]: https://b-s-h.org.uk/guidelines/guidelines/?search=acute+myeloid+leukaemia

NCCN [^NCCN2017] says use it for 
	- ? Extramedullary disease (rare) = use PET-CT.
	- Neuro dis & complications = Use MR with Gd or CT for haem.

Nil that I can find demonstrating CT effective in classifying patients.
