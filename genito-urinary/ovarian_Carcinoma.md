| Term | Definition | Information |
|:---|:---|:---|
| | **General Terminology** | |
| Size | Bi-axial at 90 for non-nodal<br>SAD for nodes. | |
Adnexa | Ovaries, fallopian tubes and supporting structures including broad ligament, vessels | |
Lesion | Not normal physiology on imaging criteria | | 
Carcinomatosis | Metastatic disease involving peritoneum | | 
Implant | Lesion on the serosa or surface of an organ. Might invade into the organ | *Deposit* is also allowed. |
Parenchymal lesion | SOL within solid organs or replacing soft tissue of the organ via haematogeneous spread; not by direct invasion from an implant. | | 
| | **Adnexal Lesion specific terminology** | |  
Unilateral | One side of body ||
Bilateral | Affecting both sides | If multiple/bilateral then mention 2 largest masses, preferably the largest on each side. | |
Adnexal Lesion | Abnormality involving the ovaries, fallopian tubes, broad ligament or the vessels of the adnexa. | Can also use *mass* |
Cystic | Portion of an adnexal lesion that is not fluid | |
Solid Component | Part of an adnexal lesion which is not fluid. |
i. *Solid tissue* | A solid component that usually demonstrates enhacement and has the following morphology:<br> - Papillary projection<br> - Mural nodule<br> - Irregular septation.<br>Or, Solid enhancing part of an adnexal lesion. | But not normal ovarian stroma. | 
ii. *Other solid components* | Includes smooth septations/walls (thin or thick), debris, fat, calcification or clot. | |
| | Peritoneal Carcinomatosis-specific Terminology | | 
| **Morphology** | | | 
| Nodule | Round or irregular tissue, 3cm or less in maximum dimension | Can be poorly defined |
| Mass | Round or irregular tissue, greater than 3cm in maximum dimension | | 
| Stranding or Infiltration | Hazy appearance of the peritoneal, omental or mesenteric fat | Can be due to inflammation, prior surgery or ascites.<br>*Haziness* is **not** recommended. | 
| Peritoneal thickening or nodularity | Smooth or nodular / irregular thickening of the peritoneal lining | |
| Invasion | Growth or direct extension / penetration into surrounding organs or tissues. | Sometimes peritoneal disease may invade an adjacent organ including Liver, spleen, bowel loop or abdominal wall. | 
| Tethering | Binding or attachment between the bowel and/or organs | Can be due to tumour, adhesions, infection/inflammation involving the peritoneum |
| **Locations** | | | 
| i. Peritoneal Cavity | Potential space between the parietal and visceral peritoneum that envelopes the abdominal organs. | Includes peritoneal lining, mesentery and omentum. | 
| ii. Subdiaphragmatic | Peritoneal cavity along the surface of the diaphragm = RIGHT & LEFT subdiaphragmatic spaces. | **Hard-to-resect / Irresectable Site** 
| iii Perihepatic | Close approximation to the liver including gastrohepatic ligament, porta hepatis or peri-portal region, RIGHT or part of LEFT subdiaphragmatic space, RIGHT or part of LEFT subhepatic space, lesser sac, falciform ligament, left intersegmental fissure, gallbladder fossa, Morrison's pouch. | Overlaps between subdiaphragmatic, perihepatic and perisplenic terms. NB: always indicate subdiaphragmatic disease if present. | 
| iv. Perisplenic | Close approximation to the spleen includes part of LEFT subdiaphragmatic and LEFT subhepatic space, gastrosplenic, splenocolic ligament and splenic hilum. | | 
| v. Lesser Sac | Peritoneal space posterior to stomach that extends through the Foramen of Winslow | **Hard-to-resect / Unresectable Site** |
| vi. Omentum | Fat between a double peritoneal layer that extends from stomach and duodenal bulb to adjacent organs | *Greater Omentum* = attaches to stomach and hangs like an apron from transverse colon.<br>*Lesser Omentum* = 2 contiguous components called gastrohepatic and hepatoduodenal ligaments. Attach the stomach and duodenal bulb to the Liver. | 
| vii. Gastrocolic ligament | Space between anterior stomach and the transverse colon | **Hard-to-resect / Irresectable Site** 
| viii. Gastrosplenic ligament | Ligament connecting superior 1/3 of greater curvature to the splenic hilum | | 
| ix. Mesenteric | Double fold of peritoneum attaching the bowel to the posterior abdominal wall. Contains soft tissue and vessels. | **Hard-to-resect / Irresectable Site** <br>Mesenteric involvement indicates tumour deposits in the mesentery. Mesenteric involvement is suspected with mesenteric retraction, nodules or small bowel loop tethering. | 
| x. Serosal | Visceral peritoneum surrounding bowel or solid organ. 
| xi. Paracolic gutters/posterior peritoneal lining | Space lateral to the peritoneal reflections to the left and right side of the colon. | RIGHT paracolic gutter communicates freely with RIGHT subdiaphragmatic space whilst the LEFT is partly limited by the splenocolic ligament. BUT, both gutters communicate freely with pelvic spaces and serve as routes of peritoneal disease spread. |  
| | | |
| xii. Paravesical | Spaces around the bladder inc: Anterior paravesical, supravesical, vesicouterine spaces, and medial and lateral inguinal fossae. | | |
| xiii.

| xiv. Pouch of Douglas / cul-de-sac | Retrouterine space between rectum and posterior wall of the uterus. | Is most dependent part of the peritoneum. |
|  | **4. Lymph node-specific terminology** | | 
| **Morphology** | | | 
| *Oval* | Length > Width | Both benign & malignant. | 
| *Round* | Length ~ Width | Ratio of short to long axis >0.8 means likely to be metastatic for nodes between 8 and 10mm SAD. | Both benign & malignant |

### Points made in Lexion  

**Peritoneal Implantation**
If peritoneal implant has smooth contour with liver => suggests no invasion.  
But, if ill-defined, irregular or interface obliteration => suggests invasion.  

**Perihepatic implants** along bare area == always look for & mention.  
Lesser Sac implants or Gastrocolic implants => Not easily seen on laparoscopy and may need more aggressive approach, thus often have neo-adj chemo. 
Extensive bowel involvement Stage IV ( rather than serosal implants Stage III) should be called as may need pre-op assessment by serum albumin to determine resectability. 

Disease involvement in root of small-bowel mesentery or upper abdominal or suprarenal retroperitoneal lymph node involvement is associated with higher rates of suboptimal cytoreduction. 

**Mesenteric involved nodes vs mesenteric implants** can be difficult to separate. Involved nodes often round, enlarged, heterogeneous and irregular / spiculated. Whilst implants can look similar they are usually accompanied with other peritoneal involvement findings such as ill-defined peritoneal involvement elsewhere, nodulariy, mesenteric root retraction or fluid between mesenteric folds.   

**Pelvic sidewall invasion** call in detail.  

No agreement to include any various peritoneal carcinomatosis.
