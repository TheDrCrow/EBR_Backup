Term | Definition | Information 
|:---|:---|:---|
| | **General Terminology** | |
Size | Bi-axial at 90 for non-nodal<br>SAD for nodes. | |
Adnexa | Ovaries, fallopian tubes and supporting structures including broad ligament, vessels | |
Lesion | Not normal physiology on imaging criteria | | 
Carcinomatosis | Metastatic disease involving peritoneum | | 
Implant | Lesion on the serosa or surface of an organ. Might invade into the organ | *Deposit* is also allowed. |
Parenchymal lesion | SOL within solid organs or replacing soft tissue of the organ via haematogeneous spread; not by direct invasion from an implant. | | 
| | **Adnexal Lesion specific terminology** | |  
Unilateral | One side of body ||
Bilateral | Affecting both sides | If multiple/bilateral then mention 2 largest masses, preferably the largest on each side. | |
Adnexal Lesion | Abnormality involving the ovaries, fallopian tubes, broad ligament or the vessels of the adnexa. | Can also use *mass* |
Cystic | Portion of an adnexal lesion that is not fluid | |
Solid Component | Part of an adnexal lesion which is not fluid. |
i. *Solid tissue* | A solid component that usually demonstrates enhacement and has the following morphology:<br> - Papillary projection<br> - Mural nodule<br> - Irregular septation.<br>Or, Solid enhancing part of an adnexal lesion. | But not normal ovarian stroma. | 
ii. *Other solid components* | Includes smooth septations/walls (thin or thick), debris, fat, calcification or clot. | |
| | Peritoneal Carcinomatosis-specific Terminology | | 
| **Morphology** | | | 
| Nodule | Round or irregular tissue, 3cm or less in maximum dimension | Can be poorly defined |
| Mass | Round or irregular tissue, greater than 3cm in maximum dimension | | 
| Stranding or Infiltration | Hazy appearance of the peritoneal, omental or mesenteric fat | Can be due to inflammation, prior surgery or ascites.<br>*Haziness* is **not** recommended. | 
| Peritoneal thickening or nodularity | Smooth or nodular / irregular thickening of the peritoneal lining | |
| Invasion | Growth or direct extension / penetration into surrounding organs or tissues. | Sometimes peritoneal disease may invade an adjacent organ including Liver, spleen, bowel loop or abdominal wall. | 
| Tethering | Binding or attachment between the bowel and/or organs | Can be due to tumour, adhesions, infection/inflammation involving the peritoneum |
| **Locations** | | | 
| i. Peritoneal Cavity | Potential space between the parietal and visceral peritoneum that envelopes the abdominal organs. | Includes peritoneal lining, mesentery and omentum. | 
| ii. Subdiaphragmatic | Peritoneal cavity along the surface of the diaphragm = RIGHT & LEFT subdiaphragmatic spaces. | **Hard-to-resect / Unresectable Site** 
| iii Perihepatic | Close approximation to the liver including gastrohepatic ligament, porta hepatis or peri-portal region, RIGHT or part of LEFT subdiaphragmatic space, RIGHT or part of LEFT subhepatic space, lesser sac, falciform ligament, left intersegmental fissure, gallbladder fossa, Morrison's pouch. | Overlaps between subdiaphragmatic, perihepatic and perisplenic terms. NB: always indicate subdiaphragmatic disease if present. | 
| iv. Perisplenic | Close approximation to the spleen includes part of LEFT subdiaphragmatic and LEFT subhepatic space, gastrosplenic, splenocolic ligament and splenic hilum. | |
