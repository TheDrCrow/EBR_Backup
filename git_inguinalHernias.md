# Abdominal Hernias  

## US and Inguinal Hernias.  

### Can they be used for clinically occult herniae?  

NB: Dynamed says most hernias are diagnosable in men purely clinically and points out about 1/3 are asymptomatic.

### **Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 2018** [^Kwee2018]

- n=16 studies, only 2 without verification bias. 
- of these 2 Sensitivity was 29% or 91%. Specificity=90%.
- lots of issues with the studies. did not do pooled analyses apart from PPV = 86%.
- Seems to be accurate for diff inguinal vs femoral. 

### CONCLUSION
More studies needed. Accuracy variable.

## Anterior Wall Hernias 

### Umbilical Hernias  [^StatDx2021]

[^StatDx2021]: https://my.statdx.com/document/ventral-hernia/3ca94c86-62fd-41ef-bb1e-c44cfd5e0710?searchTerm=ventral%20hernia&searchType=documents&category=All 

#### **CONGENITAL** 
Normal in children upto 4-6 y old. Black>>White.  
PATH: Relative deficiency in upper part of the umbilical ring which fails to fuse and scar adequately and herniation of peritoneal fat +/- bowel happens.   
CF: Rare to stick. 80% will self-resolve.
Rx: Surg only if large, symptomatic or persistent >5yr old.

#### **ACQUIRED**  
Middle aged women >> men. But men more likely to incarcerate.
Rx: Surg if big or symptomatic.

### Ventral Hernia  

DEFN: Midline & Lateral but not umbilical.  

- *Epigastric* = Above umbilicus in linea alba.
- *Hypogastric* = Below umbilicus in linea alba. 
PATH: 
- Tend not to get better and progress.
- Congenital diastasis & acquired factors including obesity, trauma. 
Rx: For any symptomatic one then surgery.  
Debate about asymptomatic.
