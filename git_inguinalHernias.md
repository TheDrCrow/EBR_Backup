# US and Inguinal Hernias.
## Can they be used for clinically occult herniae?

NB: Dynamed says most hernias are diagnosable in men purely clinically and points out about 1/3 are asymptomatic.

### **Systematic Review and Meta-analysis 2018** [^Kwee2018]

- n=16 studies, only 2 without verification bias. 
- of these 2 Sensitivity was 29% or 91%. Specificity=90%.
- lots of issues with the studies. did not do pooled analyses apart from PPV = 86%.
- Seems to be accurate for diff inguinal vs femoral. 

### CONCLUSION
More studies needed. Accuracy variable.
