## **Outline**  

Follow TNM and[^King_2021] use for basis of template for structured reporting.   

---

## Tumour 

THINK **2cm** and **4cm** as cut off in MAX dimension. 

Always measure Depth of Invastion (DOI). Measured from presumed basal membrane inwards ie Deep. Not very accurate but correlates with the risk of Nodal disease.  

--- 

## Nodes

THINK **3cm** and **6cm** as cut offs in MAX dimension.  
*Use 10mm etc in maximum shortest axial dimension as cut off for involvement*.   

#### N Staging *(all except NP and p16 OP)*

Nodal Stage | Number + Site | Size (Max Dim) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| N1 | Single. Ipsilateral. | =< 3cm. No ENE | 
| N2a | Single. Ipsilateral | >3 to 6cm. No ENE | 
| N2b | Multiple. Ipsilateral | <6cm. No ENE | 
| N2c | Bilateral or Contralateral | <6cm. No ENE | 
| N3a | Any | >6cm. No ENE. | 
| N3b | Any | Clinical ENE | 

>ENE is measured clinically BUT still look for it and call it! It is skin involvement or soft tissue invasion with deep fixation or tethering to underlying muscle or adjacent tissue. Or clinical signs of nerve involvement (CN, Brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion)

## **Oral Cavity (OC)**

### Anatomy & Terminology

Consists of 'Subsites' = 
1. **Lips** - mucosal surface of. 
2. **Anterior 2/3 of tongue.** - *upto the circumvallate papilla*. 
3. **Floor of mouth** - includes the sublingual spaces (SLS).
4. **Buccal mucosa** - lines the cheeks. 
5. **Gingival mucosa** - overlies the *upper and lower alveolar ridges* of the maxilla and mandible.
6. **Retromolar trigone** - mucosa covering the last lower molar tooth and over the anterior ramus.  
7. **Palatal Mucosa** 

>Gap between cheek & alveolar ridges = *Oral Vestibule*.  

**Oral Tongue** consists of:
- Tip 
- Ventral Surface (=undersurface)
- Dorsal Surface 
- Lateral borders.  

Tongue muscles are *Intrinsic* = No bony attachment. or *Extrinsic* = Attached to bone.   
Each half has separate blood supply & innervation with *Lingual septum (=raphe)* which is avascular & fibrofatty.  

**Floor of Mouth** = Beneath mobile tongue and bounded by lower alveolar ridges. Inferior border is the *Mylohyoid* which separates from submental space.   
Its contents are in the Sublingual space = Sublingual and minor salivary glands. Submandibular *(Wharton's)* duct, part of Hyoglossus muscle. Lingual artery, vein and nerve as well as Hypoglossal nerve. 

#### Pathology 

90% are SCC.[^Bhatia_2020] 
Others = minor salivary gland tumours, lymphoma, melanoma, sarcoma, odontogenic tumours, miscellaneous tumours.   

Most detected early.  
In West:
	- Lip 40% (UV)
	- Gingival & Buccal mucosa 20%
	- Oral Tongue 15% 
	- Floor of Mouth 15% 
	- Hard Palate 5%  
In Asia Gingival & Buccal mucosa = 75% due to Betel and tobacco chewing.  

### T Staging of Lip and Oral Cavity.

| Tumour | Description | 
|:---|:---| 
Tis | Carcinoma in Situ. 
T1 | Max dimension =<2cm + DOI =< 5mm.
T2 | Max =<2cm + DOI = 5 to 10mm. OR <br>Max >2cm to 4cm + DOI =<10mm.  
T3 | Max >4cm OR DOI >10mm.  
T4a | **Lip**: invades through Cortical bone, Inferior alveolar nerve, Floor of mouth or Skin of chin or nose.<br>**Oral Cavity**: invades Cortical bone of mandible or maxilla, Maxillary sinus, or Skin of face. 
T4b | **Both**: Invades Masticator space, Pterygoid plates, Skull base or encases ICA. 

> Superficial erosion of the bone/tooth socket by a gingival primary is not enough to call T4.	

#### Spread Patterns. aka Local invasion. 

One way to assess HNSCC spread is to think in terms of type of tissue - so skin, soft tissue, nerves etc[^King_2021]  

| Tumour subsite | Direction | Into | Notes
|:---|:---|:---|:---| 
| **Lip** | Superficial | Adjacent Skin (Chin or Nose =T4a) | | 
| | Posterior | Soft Tissue (FoM or Tongue Base = T4a)<br>Nerves (Inferior Alveolar Nerve = T4a, *Mental nerves*)<br>Bone (Maxilla or Mandible = T4a). 
| | Deep | Bone (Pterygoid plate or Skull base = T4b)<br>Muscle (Masticator space =T4b)<br>Vessels (ICA encasement = T4b)
| **Buccal** | Superficial | Buccinator Muscle *into*<br>Buccal Fat<br>Subcut Fat<br>Retromolar trigone<br>Skin (T4a) | Buccinator spread is often early. | 
|  | Posterior | Buccogingival sulci *onto*<br>Alveolar Gingiva *to*<br>Retromolar Trigone<br>Mandibular/Max Bone (T4a) 
| | Deep | Masticator space (T4b)<br>Pterygoid plates or Skull base (T4b)<br>ICA encasement (T4b)
| **Gingival** | Lower<br>*More Common* |Buccogingival sulcus<br>Buccal mucosa<br>Skin of cheek (T4a)<br>Floor of mouth<br>Bone of mandible^^ (T4a)<br>Inferior Alveolar Nerve (already T4a)| Frequently superficial along mucosa.<br>^^ Superficial bone or early socket stuff does not affect prognosis and thus T4 stage.|
| | Upper | Upper buccogingival sulcus *medial to*<br>Palate mucosa<br>Maxillary alveolar bone (T4a)<br>Maxillary Sinus(T4a) | 
| | Deep | Masticator space (T4b)<br>Pterygoid plates or Skull base (T4b)<br>ICA encasement (T4b)
| **Retromolar Trigone** | Anteromedial | Alveolar Gingiva<br>Palate<br>Floor of mouth<br>Maxillary bone (T4a)| Will spread early and rapidly<br>At interface with OP & OC.
| | Posteromedial | Tonsil<br>Tongue base<br>Mandible (T4a) | Early into mandible. | 
| | Deep | Masticator space (T4b)<br>Pterygoid plates or Skull base (T4b)<br>ICA encasement (T4b) | Skull base via pterygomandibular raphe.| 
| **Oral Tongue** | Superficial | Floor of Mouth<br>Lower gingiva<br>Mandible (T4a)|  | 
| | Posterior | Oropharyngeal tongue<br>Hypopharynx<br>Larynx | | 
| | Deep | Masticator space (T4b)<br>Pterygoid plates or Skull base (T4b)<br>ICA encasement (T4b) | Skull base via pterygomandibular raphe.| 
| **Floor of Mouth** | Anterior | Within SLS<br>Crossing the midline<br>Tongue.| Spreads easily. 
| | Lateral | Gingival mucosa<br>Manibular bone (T4a) | 
| | Posteriorly<br>*Unusual*| Submandibular space (SMS) *thru*<br>Mylohyoid muscle *into*<br>Submental space<br>Lingual nerves (??) | 
| | Deep | Masticator space (T4b)<br>Pterygoid plates or Skull base (T4b)<br>ICA encasement (T4b) | Skull base via pterygomandibular raphe.|
| **Palate** | | Upper alveolus<br>Soft palate<br>Hard Palate Bone (T4a)<br>Alveolus Bone (T4a)<br>Nasal Cavity (T4a)<br>Maxillary Sinus (T4a)<br>Greater & Lesser Palatine Canals *then to*<br>Pterygopalatine fossa *then to*<br>Skull Base (T4b) | Most masses here are Salivary gland and most of them benign esp Pleomorphic adenomas.<br>Neural invasion via Palatine canals and PPF can be discontinuous = thus look carefully.

For Surgical Planning then in **Oral Tongue** need to state:
	1. Bulk (1/3 or more)
	2. Size and Depth of invasion. 
	3. Min distance to Lingual NV bundle. 
	4. Min distance to contra Lingual NV bundle. 
	5. Midline Raphe: Min distance to / Involved. 
	6. Tongue Base / Larynx involvement. 

### Nodes from Oral Cavity. 

**Level I and II**  
Often bilateral esp if midline.
Also look at Retropharyngeal and Parotid.

### Treatment 

Depends on Location, Size and Extent. 

Small = WLE or Brachy. 
Large / Extensive = RT, ChemoRT or Combination with surgery.  

For tongue : Avoid total glossectomy and usual give ChemoRT.
Normally do WLE or partial glossectomies preserving at least one lingual NV bundle.

## **Nasopharynx (NP)**

---

## **Oropharynx (OP)**

Only site at present using HPV status as a guide. Uses P16 tumour suppression gene overexpression on immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for HPV status. ( Cheap, widely available, cheap ) HPV subtyping via in-situ hybridisation is also then carried out.   
p16 tumours are *generally* smaller but with more advanced nodes than p16 negative.  

Nearly all SCC. 
Salivary gland malignancies - Adenoid cystic & Mucoepidermoid carcinoma - Uncommon. Tend to be higher T2.  
Soft palate frequently have Pleomorphic adenomas. 

### T - Staging of Oropharyngeal Tumours  

| Tumour | Description | 
|:---|:---| 
Tis | Carcinoma in situ 
T1 | Max Dimension < 2cm 
T2 | Max Dimension >2cm to 4cm 
T3 | Max Dimension >4cm<br>OR, Extends to mucosa of epiglottis if primary is Tongue base or Vallecula.
T4a | Tumour invades:<br>- Larynx<br>- Deep muscles or Extrinsic muscles of tongue (=Genioglossus, Hyoglossus, Palatoglossus,Styloglossus)<br>- Medial Pterygoid muscle<br>- Hard Palate<br>- Mandible.   
T4b | Tumour invases:<br>- Lateral pterygoid muscle<br>- Pterygoid plates<br>- Lateral Nasopharynx<br>- Skull Base<br>- Encases the Carotid artery.  

>For p16/HPV SCC then T4a and T4b are combined as T4a.
