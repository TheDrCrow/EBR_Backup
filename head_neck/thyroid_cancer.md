# Thyroid Cancer 

## Classification

### WHO 2017

A) **Borderline Tumours**
  - Follicular tumour of uncertain malignant potential FT-UMP
  - Well differentiated tumour of uncertain malignant potential WDT-UMP 
  - Non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary nuclear features NIFTP  
> Equivalent to CIS in other structures  

B) **Malignant Tumours**  
  1. Thyroid Cell Origin  
  - Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma & variants 
  - Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma  
  - Hurthle Cell Carcinoma 
  - Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
  - Anaplastic thyroid Carcinoma
  2. Neuroendocrine C - cell 
  - Medullary Carcinoma 
  3. Thyroid Lymphoma
  4. Miscellaneous 
  5. Metastatic  

  *"Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma"* (**DTC**)  
  Most common ~95% of Thyroid Ca  
  from Thyroid Follicular Epithelial Cells  
  Are PTC, FTC and Hurthle Cell  

## Aetiology

#### Genetics 
MEN2 / Cowden syndrome / FAP 
Specific gene mutations including RET, TRK, RAS, BRAF, PPArG, TP53 

#### Environment
  - Radiation. Especially childhood
  - Iodine rich areas => PTC 
  - Iodine poor areas => FTC & Anaplastic.  *Relationship is less well defined*
  - Thyroiditis = Hashimotos => Lymphoma 


## Tumours 

Name | Demo | Histo | CF | Prognosis 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
**Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma**<br>(PTC) | 70% of all<br>x= 30-40y 3F:1M<br>Risks: Radiation<br>Iodine |Low-grade tumour<br>Psammoma Bodies => MicroCa<br>Freq Multicentric => Worse prog but still low | Spread: Regional LN<br>Then often stops<br>Rare => Mets: Lung>Bone, Liver, Brain<br>Microcarcinoma <10mm, clinically silent, excellent prognosis. 37% of Finns at PM.| Generally Excellent<br>But behaviour varies with age<br>In young <50yo then LN+ => No fx on RIP<br>>5cm => No fx on RIP<br>Lung mets => Mild fx on RIP<br>But >50yo then they all have sig fx as well as histo<br>For <2cm tumours then Age>45, LN+, Mets+, Extrathyroid extension => ^RIP.  
**Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma** (FTC) | 20% of all<br>x=50y 3F:1M<br>Risks: Radiation<br>Iodine deficiency| Slow-growing. Looks like normal thyroid tissue esp on cyto though can have sheets of anaplastic cells as well<br>Ca is rare<br>Multicentric is rare<br>Assessing malignancy is tricky and usually by vasc invasion +/- mets | Spread: LN = Rare<br>Mets => Bone, liver, lungs.
