## Specific Tumours 

### Inverted Papilloma (IP)
**Path**: Ecto derived ciliated respiratory membrane (= *Schneiderian membrane*)  
Leads to 3 types of papilloma = 
  1. Inverted (60%) : Benign & locally aggressive. +/- EBV/HPV ~20% have foci of Carcinoma. 
  2. Oncocytic
  3. Fungiform  

**Demo**: M 40-70. 
**Site**: Lateral nasal wall in region of the middle turbinate / ethmoid recess.  
  grows into Max + Ethmoid sinuses. 

**Radiology**:
- CT 
  1. Solitary polyp => unilateral obstruction. 
  2. Ca2+ = Common. 
  3. Focal hyperostosis (65%). Often pear or plaque shaped.
- MRI 
  1. *Convoluted Cribiform Pattern* (CCP) 96% PPV.
  2. T2 = alt Inc/Dec bands.
- PET 
  1. FDG = High in Inverted and SCC degeneration.  

> Generally diff to tell IP and Ca even on histo due to foci of Ca.  
**Rx:** Surgical Resection : mostly open, more endoscopic.
**Recurrence:** ~15%

### Juvenile Angiofibroma 
**Demo**: Rare. Only M. If F then mosaic.  
**Path:** Testosterone - sensitive myofibroblast.   
Locally invasive vascular tissue in fibrous stroma 
**Site**: Sphenopalatine foramen => PPF
**Spread**: 
- Medially => Nose & nasopharynx  
- Laterally => Pterygomaxillary fissure => Infratemporal Fossa.  
- Superiorly => IOF => Orbital apex
- Posteriorly => Vidian or Foramen Rotundem => MCF  
Invades Sphenoid (60%), Maxillary (43%), Ethmoid (35%)  

**Radiology**
- CT = 2x characteristic features on CT 
  1. Mass in Nose & PPF. 
  2. Erosion of Bone behind Sphenopalatine foramen at root of medial pterygoid plate.   
- MR = Delineate full extent of tumour. 
  1. T2 = Intermediate and heterogeneous signal with flow voids. 
  2. Gd +++  

> Invasion into Sphenoid predicts recurrence.  

**Rx:** Angio of ECA then resect. 
**Recurrence:** 15-20% often in basisphenoid thus surveillance.  
RT is used if unresectable.  

### AdenoCarcinoma  AC

**Demo**: 3M:F 50-60 Risks=  Wood 500-900x, Leather. 
**CF**: Usual and epistaxis. 
**Path**: From surface epithelium or minor salivary gland rests.  
Intestinal-type Adenocarcinoma is most common type.  
4 sub-types: 
  1. Colonic (40%)
  2. Solid 
  3. Papillary 
  4. Mucinous / Mixed type.  
**Site:** 
 - Ethmoid: 40% 
 - Nasal Cavity 30% 
 - Maxillary 25%   
**Radiology** 
 - Poorly defined mass. 
 - Bone destruction > remodelling. 
 - Enhancement ++ 
 - FDG useful for Met vs 1y AC
**Prognosis:** 
= f(grade)
 - 8% LN at presentation. 
 - 13% distant mets at presentation. 
 - 5y OS = 50%. 50% will recur => RIP. 

### Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma SNUC 

**Demo:** 3M:F 8-85y.  x= 50s. Rare.
**Path:** Uncertain histiogenesis.
**Site:** Nasal cavity => Ethmoid > Maxillary cavity. 
**Radiology:** 
 - Large (>4cm) 
 - Invasive +
 - Bone Destruction ++ 
**Prog**:
 - 25% LN at presentation. 
 - Mets -> Bone, Brain & liver. 
 - 5y OS = 35% 

### Minor Salivary Gland Tumours 

#### Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma = most common. 

**Demo**: 20-91y 
**CF**: Occ Facial numbness due to V2 invasion. 
**Path:** 
 - Low Grade, thus insidious, thus 2/3 T4 at presentation. 
 - 50% have perineural spread. 
**Site** 
- 60% Maxillary sinus. 
- 25% Nasal Cavity 
**Radiology:**
 - Low grade = Solid, enhancing, well-defined mass +/- bone remodelling (?polyps)
 - High grade = heterogeneous, enhancing, poorly defined mass with bone Destruction
 - FDG = Low uptake. 

### Olfactory Neuroblastoma ON 
**Demo**: Rare=2% of Sinonasal Tumours, 2-90y x= 40y. 
**Path:** Olfactory mucosa, thus Cribiform plate but also ectopic = lower nasal cavity or sinuses.Rarely intracranial. 
**CF**: Occ paraneoplastic inc Cushings & SIADH. 
**Staging:** 
KADISH A:In nasal cavity. B Nasal cavity & Sinuses. C:Beyond Sinonasal Cavity D:Regional nodes (6%) or mets (7%)
**Radiology**:
 - Dumb-bell shaped in superior nasal cavity with waist at cribiform plate.
 - Bone-remodelling > Destruction 
 - T1:Low/Int T2: Int/High. Occ cystic from necrosis. 
 - Enhance: +++ homogeneous.
 - FDG: Often used as upstages 36%. 
 - FU: Gd MRI inc Neck = 4m for 2y, 6m for 2-5y, then 9m for life. 
**Prognosis:** 
 - 5/10y OS = 62% / 46%. 
 - 10y OS for A = 83% but D = 13% 
 - Local recurrence upto 60% 
 - Mets -> Brain, dura, lung, liver, parotid, bone, cord, skin in 15% at usually 1-20 months post but can be upto 10ys
 **Rx:**
 - Craniofacial resection & RT and neoadj Platinum chemoRx
 - No neck dissection unless indicated. 

### Mucosal Melanoma MMHN

**Demo:** M=F 60s. Rare = 4% of SN tumours & <1% of all MMs(but 8% in Japan). Risks: Formaldehyde
**Path:** Neuroectodermal  
No ref point to measure invasion thus all are T3+ 
 - Sites: 52% Nasal cavity, 20% Paranasal sinuses.  
15% Regional Nodes at presentation. <10% Mets. 
50% End up with distant mets.  
**Radiology**:  
 - Often polypoid. 
 - T1 High / T2 low 
 - Amelanotic = Intermediate mostly 
 - Gd +++
**Rx:** Surgery not RT. Then immunotherapy. RT for recurrences occasionally
**Prognosis:** 5yOS = 30% 

### Sinonasal NHL 

**Demo:** 3M:F x=53y for NK Tcell. M:F x=63y for DLBCL.   
14% of all SN tumours. 
**CF**: Mostly local signs  +/- B symptoms.  
Rare in NK T-cell is Haemophagocytic syndrome with pancytopenia.  
**Path**: 2 main types:
 - DLBCL = Most 
 - NK / T-cell lymphoma = in Asia / S. America . 100% EBV but role not clear. 
**Radiology:**
 - CT: High. But variable. 
 - Gd++ 
 - Bone destruction is common. 
 - FDG: High for both. 


### Sinonasal Chondrosarcoma 

**Demo**: Rare 0.1% of all H+N, but most common sarcoma. M>F 60s. 
**Radiology**
- CT: 'Rings and arcs' Ca2+ with Low matrix. 
- MR: Matrix is High T2. 
- Gd: +/++
**Prognosis** Good but late recurrence is common.

### Sinonasal Osteosarcoma  

**Demo**: M:F 20-30 
**Path:** 
- Site: Jaw > Maxilla (alveolar ridge)
**Radiology** 
- Osteoid matrix
- Sunburst periosteal reaction. 
- T1 = look for marrow infiltration.
