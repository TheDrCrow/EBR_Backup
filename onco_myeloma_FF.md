### NICE Guidelines 2016 [^NICE2016]  

#### ***1) Imaging for Suspected Myeloma***  

**WB - MRI at First Diagnosis**   

> Offer imaging to all people with a plasma cell disorder suspected to be myeloma.  
> Consider whole-body MRI as first-line imaging.  
> Consider whole-body low-dose CT as first-line imaging if wholebody MRI is unsuitable or the person declines it.  

  1. Markov model assumes S/S of 1 / 0.95 despite the only study in the analysis which has full peformance data (which are the 2 largest) quoting figures of 0.63 / 0.72 for focal disease and 0.61 / 0.62 for diffuse disease. Why use such ridiculous figures plucked from nowhere?   
  > *"From the GC’s clinical experience and supported somewhat by low quality evidence MRI was assumed to be the most
  > diagnostically accurate, in terms of both sensitivity and specificity."*  p71 of Full Guidance
  - But guideline committe's experience of patients >70 is next to zero. 
  2. Resource costs are non-representative   
   
   | Procedure   | Cost |
   | :---------- | ---: |
   | Skel Survey | £108 |
   | WB-MRI      | £203 |
   | Spine MR    | £199 |
   | WB-CT       | £147 |
   | PET-CT      | £605 |

  3. The cost-effectiveness analysis does not entirely back up the conclusions as only if QUALY willingness to pay >£20K was WB MRI better than CT. And in the write up they state that the lack of decent economic and head to head diagnostic data makes it difficult to be sure which is better.  But the write up states that MR is the preferred technique = why? 
 
  4. State that the cost-effectiveness is dependent on the reduction in follow up cross-sectional imaging = But we rarely used this!

> For people with newly diagnosed myeloma or smouldering myeloma who have not had whole-body imaging with 1 of the following, consider whole-body imaging to assess for myeloma-related bone disease and extra-medullary plasmacytomas with one of:  
>  MRI  
>  CT  
>  fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT (FDG PET-CT).  


#### **2) Imaging later in Disease**  

> Consider symptom-directed imaging for people with myeloma or smouldering myeloma if any new bone symptoms develop. 
> 
> For people with myeloma and serological relapse or disease progression, consider one of the following (taking into consideration previous imaging tests):  
>  whole-body MRI  
>  spinal MRI  
>  fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT (FDG PET-CT).  
>  
> For people with smouldering myeloma and disease progression, consider one of the following (taking into consideration previous imaging tests):  
>  whole-body MRI  
>  whole-body low-dose CT  
>  whole-body CT  
>  spinal MRI  
>  fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT (FDG PET-CT).  

But p268 states 
> "no studies were identified that investigated follow-up protocols for patients with myeloma so no evidence was found on any of these outcomes."   [^NICE2016]

The write-up points out the paucity of data here then discusses that SS are no good really but then comes up with the above recommendations which is odd as in the same secton they quote the papers they use in a table and in it:
  - 3 x studies of WB-MRI in relapse / PD, each with n=30  patients
  - 1 x study of WB CT in detecting relapse / PD with n=439
  - CT S/S = 0.995 / 0.96 whilst WB-MRI = 0.82 / 0.62 
  - **No** mention of what it is trying to do, given the definition of PD/relapse is mostly non-imaging.   

> "*Whilst there were potential cost implications of making recommendations in this area, other questions in the guideline were agreed as higher priorities for economic evaluation.*"

## **Clinical**

### What does Diffusion Weighted whole body imaging do in Myeloma? 
  1. Diagnose Myeloma. 
  2. Stage Myeloma. 
  3. Prognosticate Myeloma.
  4. Assess need for treatment (similar to above) = 'Activity assessment'
  5. Assess disease response. 
  6. Assess need for treatment in chronic patient. 
  7. Define which treatment. Chemotherapeutically.
  8. Define which treatment. Local treatments. 

For each of the above one would have to demonstrate that MR is BETTER than standard techniques and that the additional resource is beneficial. 
This would include CT scan as this is cheaper and more likely to be

## **Differentials**

## **Radiological**

### ADC Values [^Messiou2019]

Not yet part of the standard. But,  
Normal bone marrow usually BELOW 600-700 um2/sec.  
Viable tumour usually ABOVE 700 um2/sec UPTO 1400.
