# Melanoma: Assessment and Management
## NICE NG14 July 2015

### Imaging

> #### 1.5 Staging Investigations. 

> 1.5.3 Offer CT staging to people with stage IIC who have NOT had sentinel lymph node biopsy, and to all people with stage III or stage IV melanoma. 
> 
> 1.5.4 Include the brain as part of imaging for people with suspected stage IV melanoma.
>
> 1.5.5 Consider whole‑body MRI for children and young people (from birth to 24 years) with stage III or suspected stage IV melanoma.


> #### 1.9 Follow Up after treatment for Melanoma. 

> 1.9.3 Consider including the brain for people having imaging as part of follow‑up after treatment for melanoma.
>
> 1.9.4 Consider imaging the brain if metastatic disease outside the central nervous system is suspected.
>
> 1.9.5 Consider CT rather than MRI of the brain for adults having imaging as part of the follow-up or if metastatic disease is suspected.

> 1.9.12 & 1.9.14 Do not routinely offer screening investigations ( including imaging and blood tests ) as part of follow-up to people who have had stage IA, IB-IIB or stage IIC with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. 

> 1.9.16 Consider surveillance imaging as part of follow-up imaging for people who have had stage IIC melanoma with no SNLB or stage III melanoma who would be eligible for systemic therapy as a result of early detection of metastatic disease if:
>  - there is a clinical trial of the value of early imaging or
>  - the SSMDM agrees to a local policy and specific funding for imaging 6-monthly for 3 yrs is identified. 

> 1.9.17 Offer personalized follow up to people who have has stage IV melanoma.

So, the important bits are 
 - CT rather than MR for brain. 
 - Stage III or IIc refusniks only. 
 - 6/12 seems to be accepted and only if there is funding.
