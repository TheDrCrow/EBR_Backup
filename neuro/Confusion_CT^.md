# What is the role of CT in elderly and confused.

With consideration for those with falls but no head injury.

### Diagnostic yield of cerebral imaging in patients with acute confusion [^Hufschmidt2011] 

[^Hufschmidt2011]: Hufschmidt A, Shabarin V. Diagnostic yield of cerebral imaging in patients with acute confusion. Acta Neurol Scand. 2008;118(4):245-250. doi:10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01006.x

**Method:**
 - retrospective admissions of acute confusion to DGH in Germany from 2008 to 2011
 - n=294, n=178 had cerebral imaging. Positive yield = 0.14. 
  
**Findings**
1. Patient with dementia and no focal signs = 0.98 are -ve.
   1. Patient with dementia, no focal signs and not drowsy = 1.0 negative
   2. Patient with dementia, no focal signs *and* fever or dehydration = Pr(1.0) negative. 
2. All patients with no focal signs *and* fever or dehydration = Pr(1.0) for negative. 
3. Single best negative predictor is ***Lack of focal signs***.

### Development of a risk score to guide brain imaging in older patients admitted with falls and confusion [^Brown2011]

[^Brown2011]: Brown AJ, Witham MD, George J. Development of a risk score to guide brain imaging in older patients admitted with falls and confusion. Br J Radiol. 2011;84(1004):756-757. doi:10.1259/bjr/78864604

**Method***
 - Derived 12 predictor parameters from literature and applied to 66 consecutive patients admitted with Falls and Confusion and who had brain imaging to Teaching Hospital in Scotland. 
 - Correlation of each risk factor; then final risk score derived. 

**Findings**
1. 20% of imaging had new path: acute ICH, Stroke, Mass. 
2. Found that
   1. - Previous history of falls
   2. - AF
   3. - Head or Face trauma
   4. - Focal neuro
   5. - Warfarin 
   6. - GCS < 14
   All predicted new path. (All +1 except Focal neuro +3)
   Whilst antecedent Dementia predicted negative = -1
1. If cut off was 3 points then S/S = .83/.89 with PPV/NPV of .63/.96. 

**Comment**
Aim to optimise the performance data but that is not the point with a screen
