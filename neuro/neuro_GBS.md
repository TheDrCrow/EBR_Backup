Radiology not listed in the diagnostic section and not listed in the 'Brighton Collaberation'.  
They use degrees of certainty from low to high. With a high one including : 
 - Clinical diagnosis ( defined in the document ), 
 - CSF WCC <50 & protein raised. 
 - Electrophysiology in keeping with Diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnosis [^Dynamed2021]

Divided into: [This does not look like a great Diff]  

1. Neuromuscular / Neurological 
   1. Brainstem / Cord Compression.
   2. Transverse Myelitis / ADEM .
   3. Acute onset of CIDP ( or now called CIDM).
   4. ALS
   5. Encephalitis
   6. Leptomeningeal malignancy  
2. Muscular Condition 
   1. Dermatomyositis
   2. Mitochondrial Disease
   3. Polymyositis.
   4. Acute Rhabdomyolysis.   
3. Acute Porphyria. 
4. DM (??). 
5. Vasculitis. 
6. Infections
   1. Botulinism
   2. Lyme
   3. HIV 
   4. Polio 
   5. West Nile encephalomyelitis
7. Metabolic & Nutrional. 
   1. Hypoglycaemia
   2. Hypokalaemia 
   3. Hypermagnesemia 
   4. Hypophosphataemia
   5. Thiamine Deficiency = Wernkckes. 
8. Medication & Toxins. 
   1. Alcohol Intoxication.
   2. Animal toxins = tick, snakes 
   3. Arsenic, lead and other heavy metal poisoning. 
   4. Hexacarbon abuse. = Glues. 
   5. OPs. 
   6. Others.   

So, looking at that. The main role for imaging is going to be:  
**Structural lesions in the cervical spine and possibly lower such as myelitis, external compression.**
