## Pituitary Tumours 
[^Bhatia_2021] [^Choudri_2017]   
Imaging [^Seeburg_2017]  

Rare <10y but 25% of all CNS in 15-19 yo.   
12% of all CNS tumours in 0-19 yo.  

Can present with endocrine, visual problems or headache or obstructive hydrocephalus.  
Can be slow and present with cognitive difficulties  and behavioural change.  
Always asses the overall midline including ? ectopic neurohypophysis.

| Name | Demographics | Pathology | Radiology | Notes 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma | 90% of all neoplasms in kids. | Derives from remnant of Rathke's pouch. 70% from intrasellar & suprasellar.| Solid within cyst. Solid part enhances. Cyst often proteinaceous. Ca2++. Describing hypothalamic involvement is tricky. | Rx:Resection and RT. Recurrence frequent & LT survivors often have sig Morb inc Obesity, panhypopit & cog dysfunction.Papillary Craniopharyngioma is a separate tumour in adults.  
Rathke Cleft Cyst (RCC)| | Ectopic remnant of Rathke's pouch. Centred between anterior & posterior lobes but can extend superiorly. | Cyst. But NO enhancement. NO Ca2++. | Might be one end of spectrum with CPP. 
Chiasmatic Glioma | | Often PA. Optic pathway = Mostly NF1. But, Chiastmatic glioma mostly NOT NF1. Not arise in adults | No Ca2 at presentation. T2:High. Gd:Var. | Can be either fusiform thickening and mostly solid OR exophytic and mixed cystic-solid.  | 
Germ Cell Tumours | 3% of all paed CNS | Germinomas, Non-Germinoma GCT, Teratomas. In Suprasellar or Pineal regions | Pit stalk, irregular lesions =>Large Mass with remodelling. Gd:++. ADC:Low. | DD: LCH ,*Sarcoid*. 
Pituitary Adenomas | Rare in Kids qv Adults | MOST endocrine active. Prolactinoma 50%, ACTH-Producing Adenoma 35% , Growth Hormone-Releasing Adenoma 10%. And are micro. | | Macroadenomas are rare but tend to non-secrete. 
Arachnoid Cyst | | 16% are suprasellar but in kids this is 75%. | | |  

> Pituicytoma, Granular Cell Tumour & Spindle Cell Oncocytoma are all viewed as 1 group of tumours all related. But might just be different presentations of the same tumour. [^Louis_2021]

Pit apoplexy can be haem or non-haem and 70% have underlying macroadenoma. But can be spontaneous.Cato

| Name | Demographics | Pathology | Radiology | Notes 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Germ Cell Tumour | Most common 50%. M>>>F Teen. | Malignant primordial tissues . Germinomas 50% of all.  20% outside Pineal. Teratomas 2nd: Fat/Ca etc| Appear:Hetero. T1:Iso/Low. T2:mild Low->High. ADC:Low. 
| Pineocytoma | All ages. Peak =20-50yo | WHO Grade 1. Histo same as normal tissue. | Well-defined, High T2 lesions. Gd:Var but not ADC low. But can be mixed cyst-solid and haem. | 
Gd:Avid,hetero. Ca2:Central | Dx:Serum & CSF aFP, bHCG, plALP Rx: Chemo & RT. 5yOS >90%.| 
| Pineoblastoma | 10% of Pineal masses. M=F | WHO Grade 4. Embryonal. Infiltrative | T1:Hetero. T2:Hetero. ADC:Low. Gd:0->Moderate. Ca2:Peripheral (qv GCT) | 5yOS<50% [Trilateral Retinoblastoma = Bilateral retinoblastoma + pineoblastoma.| | Astrocytoma |  | Often arise from thalami, CC, III etc. | T1:Low. T2:High. ADC:Var, low in HG parts. Gd:0/+. | Tectal glioma etc.   |
