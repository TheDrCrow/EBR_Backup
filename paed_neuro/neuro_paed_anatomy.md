## Myelination 

**Unmyelinated White Matter**  
- Very high water content (80%) thus, 
-`T1: LOW, T2: HIGH  

**Myelinated White Matter**
- = Proteolipid 70% Lipid, 30% Protein thus, 
- `T1: HIGH, T2: LOW.
- The water content is still 70% though.  

***But*** **Transition Phase**
- have lipid precursors thus HIGH T1, 
- but not yet hydrophobic thus high water and HIGH T2.
- Thus, T1 shortening is seen about 3 months before decline in T2.
