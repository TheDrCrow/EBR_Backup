# Supratentorial Malformations

## Abnormalities of Neuronal / Grey Matter development. 

Mature cerebral cortex has 6 layers. 
Cells start in *germinal matrix* of cerebral cortex along the margins of the lateral ventricles in 3 stages:
1. Neuronal proliferation = cells form in the germinal matrix.
2. Neuronal migration = cells move to the periphery. 
3. Neuronal organization = cells form normal cortex.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Proliferation.

#### 1) Hemimegalencephaly

S+S: Seizures, mostly severe.  
Path: Hamartomatous / dysplastic overgrowth of whole of one cerebral hemisphere.  
Rad: 
-	Increase in size of one hemi and skull
-	Venticle is LARGER on affected side.
-	++ Blood flow -> More rapid myelination. 
-	Heterotopia / Polymicrogyria  

Variants: Can affect only part of a hemisphere and thus cross over with FCD.  

#### 2) Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD)  
S+S: Seizures, incidental, Delayed development.  

**Type I**  
Path: Focal abnormal proliferation of abnormal cells.
Rad: Best seen on T1.  
- Type Ia: Abnormal Radial Lamination 
- Type Ib: Abnormal Tangential Lamination  
- Type Ic: Both.  

**Type II**  
Path: Dysmorphic neurons.  
-	Type IIa: Rad= Not obvious as IIb.  
-	Type IIb: Balloon cells = 'Taylor-type' = Tubers in TSC.  
-	-	Rad: 'Transmantle' sign = High T2 in blurred cortex which tapers in the
		direction of the lateral ventricle margin (mostly sup-lat).  

**Type III**  
Path: Associated with other lesions.  
- Type IIIa: with Hippocampal sclerosis.
- Type IIIb: with Tumour.
- Type IIIc: with Vascular Injury.
- Type IIId: with Parenchymal Injury.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Migration. 

#### 1) Heterotopia  
Path: Neurons fail to migrate to periphery of brain. 
Rad: Abnormal site of grey matter, mostly nodular. 
  T1 or DWI : Best.  
a) **Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia (PVNH)**   
 - Most common type. Mostly around trigones
 - Uni or bilateral 
 - Multi or unifocal  
 - SS= Incidental , seizures.  
 
b) **Subcortical Heterotopia** 
- Clusters or multifocal.
- Often with PVNH.
- Occasionally creates line from ventricle to cortex (DD: Schizencephaly)  

c) **Band-like Heterotopia** 
- Parallels cortex. 
- Typically bilateral and symmetrical. 
- Complete or Partial (posterior parts mostly incomplete)  
- Often with lissencephaly.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Organization.
Normal cortex is 6 layers and has adequate sulcation.  
Path: Signalling mechanism disruptions due to genetics, infection, ischaemia in
utero.  
a) **Polymicrogyria**
- Symmetrical tends to be genetic. Ca2+ tends to be TORCH esp CMV.  
- Rad: Multiple but smaller +/- nodular gyri.  
b) **Schizencephaly**  
- Follows from a transmantle (ventricle->periphery) parenchymal injury.
- Rad: Cleft from ventricle to subarachnoid space, ++/- polymicrogyria lined.
- - Can be bilateral, and subtle therefore LOOK!
- Types: 
- - Closed Lip: thin volume of tissue (DD:Transmantle heterotopia but the CLS
		will have irreguar contour in the lateral ventricle).
- - Open Lip: large volume of tissue loss and thus obvious.
