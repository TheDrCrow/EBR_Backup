# Supratentorial Malformations

## Abnormalities of Neuronal / Grey Matter development. 

Mature cerebral cortex has 6 layers. 
Cells start in *germinal matrix* of cerebral cortex along the margins of
the lateral ventricles in 3 stages:
1. Neuronal proliferation = cells form in the germinal matrix.
2. Neuronal migration = cells move to the periphery. 
3. Neuronal organization = cells form normal cortex.
