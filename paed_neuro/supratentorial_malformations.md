## Abnormalities of Neuronal / Grey Matter development. 

Mature cerebral cortex has 6 layers. 
Cells start in *germinal matrix* of cerebral cortex along the margins of the lateral ventricles in 3 stages:
1. Neuronal proliferation = cells form in the germinal matrix.
2. Neuronal migration = cells move to the periphery. 
3. Neuronal organization = cells form normal cortex.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Proliferation.

#### 1) Hemimegalencephaly

S+S: Seizures, mostly severe.  
Path: Hamartomatous / dysplastic overgrowth of whole of one cerebral hemisphere.  
Rad: 
-	Increase in size of one hemi and skull
-	Venticle is LARGER on affected side.
-	++ Blood flow -> More rapid myelination. 
-	Heterotopia / Polymicrogyria  

Variants: Can affect only part of a hemisphere and thus cross over with FCD.  

#### 2) Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD)  
S+S: Seizures, incidental, Delayed development.  

**Type I**  
Path: Focal abnormal proliferation of abnormal cells.
Rad: Best seen on T1.  
- Type Ia: Abnormal Radial Lamination 
- Type Ib: Abnormal Tangential Lamination  
- Type Ic: Both.  

**Type II**  
Path: Dysmorphic neurons.  
-	Type IIa: Rad= Not obvious as IIb.  
-	Type IIb: Balloon cells = 'Taylor-type' = Tubers in TSC.  
 	-	Rad: 'Transmantle' sign = High T2 in blurred cortex which tapers in the
		direction of the lateral ventricle margin (mostly sup-lat).  

**Type III**  
Path: Associated with other lesions.  
- Type IIIa: with Hippocampal sclerosis.
- Type IIIb: with Tumour.
- Type IIIc: with Vascular Injury.
- Type IIId: with Parenchymal Injury.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Migration. 

#### 1) Heterotopia  
Path: Neurons fail to migrate to periphery of brain. 
Rad: Abnormal site of grey matter, mostly nodular. 
  T1 or DWI : Best.  
a) **Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia (PVNH)**   
 - Most common type. Mostly around trigones
 - Uni or bilateral 
 - Multi or unifocal  
 - SS= Incidental , seizures.  
 
b) **Subcortical Heterotopia** 
- Clusters or multifocal.
- Often with PVNH.
- Occasionally creates line from ventricle to cortex (DD: Schizencephaly)  

c) **Band-like Heterotopia** 
- Parallels cortex. 
- Typically bilateral and symmetrical. 
- Complete or Partial (posterior parts mostly incomplete)  
- Often with lissencephaly.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Organization.
Normal cortex is 6 layers and has adequate sulcation.  
Path: Signalling mechanism disruptions due to genetics, infection, ischaemia in
utero.  
a) **Polymicrogyria**
- Symmetrical tends to be genetic. Ca2+ tends to be TORCH esp CMV.  
- Rad: Multiple but smaller +/- nodular gyri.  
b) **Schizencephaly**  
- Follows from a transmantle (ventricle->periphery) parenchymal injury.
- Rad: Cleft from ventricle to subarachnoid space, ++/- polymicrogyria lined.
  - Can be bilateral, and subtle therefore LOOK!
- Types: 
  - Closed Lip: thin volume of tissue (DD:Transmantle heterotopia but the CLS
		will have irreguar contour in the lateral ventricle).
  - Open Lip: large volume of tissue loss and thus obvious.

## Disorders Corpus Callosal Formation

~ 130 Genetic syndromes associated with CC abns. Most will cause severe SS.
### Agenesis of Corpus Callosum 
Rad:
  - Absence of CC, Cingulate gyrus.
  - Radiating gyri from III (Sag) with III in direct continuity with interhemispheric fissure. 
  - Parallel configuration of lateral ventricles.
  - Large atria and occcipital horns of lateral ventricles (colphocephaly)
  - +/- Interhemispheric arachnoid cyst / cystic meningeal dysplasia.   
***Probst Bundles*** = fibres that would have crossed the midline instead run in AP plane along medial margins of ventricles. 
DD: in F look for coloboma ~ AICARDI SYNDROME

### Dysgenesis of Corpus Callosum 

Path: Broad spectrum = Partial absence, abnormal morph, short AP dimension, general
thinning.  
NB: General thinning associated with WM injury or loss ( associated Wallerian degeneration ).  
***Meninx primitiva*** (Neural Crest Mesenchyme) remnants => Midline Lipoma.
These are often on dorsal surface of posterior CC, which is often dysplastic and
assoc'd CHIARI II

## Holoprosencephaly Spectrum 

Path: Failure of cleavage of ***Prosencephalon*** (embryologic forebrain) into hemispheres.  
Spectum from ALOBAR -> SEMILOBAR -> LOBAR.  

All at risk of pituitary / endocrine abn , cleft palate and other midlines.  

| Type | Interhemispheric Fissure | Thalami | Corpus Callosum | Ventricles | Septum Pellucidum | Other | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
**Alobar** | None / Minimal | Fused | Absent / Dysplastic | Dysmorphic Monoventricle | Absent | Azgous ACA, Single incisor |
**Semilobar** | Minimal | Variable fusion vs dysmorphia | Dysplastic | Dysmorphic monoventricle | Absent | | 
**Lobar** | Partial | Separate, usu N. | Mild dysplasia | Dysmorphic Ventricles | Absent | |
**Syntelencephaly** | Mostly present | Normal | Usu N, occ mid-CC dysplasia | Mildly dysmorphic | Absent | Vertically orientated sylvian fissures. | 
**Septo-optic Dysplasia** | Present | Normal | Normal / Mild dysplasia | Mostly normal | Absent | ON Hypoplasia, ectopic neurohypophysis, schizencephaly |  

### Syntelencephaly  
Mild end of spectrum. aka "Middle Hemispheric variant" 
Rad/Path: Only abnormality in ***Telencephalon***  
- Fully formed CC +/- mid-CC dysplasia. 
- Interhemispheric bridge of parenchyma ( = ***Telencephalic bridge***)
- Vertical orientation of sylvian fissure. 

### Septo-Optic Dysplasia   
Some consider to be the mildest of the Holoprosencephalies. 
Rad/Path: 
  - Absence of Septum Pellucidum 
  - +/- ON hypoplasia (often the indication for the exam ) 
  - +/- Ectopic neurohypophysis.

## Lissencephaly / Pachygyria / Agyria Spectrum [^Donato2018]

[^Donato2018]:Donato, Barkovich, Dubyns et al, Lissencephaly: expanded imaging and clinical classificationAm J Med Genet A. 2017 June ; 173(6): 1473â€“1488. doi:10.1002/ajmg.a.38245. Zotero+

Spectrum of conditions with smooth relatively featureless contour of brain   
NB: Diff = Premature!!
Now viewed as Lissencephaly Spectrum subsuming pachygyria and agyria. And with
Subcortical band heterotopia at the other end.

See [^Donato2018] for upto date classification system and correlation with clinical
features = at end of the pdf. 

***Lissencephaly*** Smooth 4 layered cortex. 
***Pachygyria*** Thick, featureless cortex.
***Agyria*** No gyri. Thus, no sulci except sylvian fissure.
