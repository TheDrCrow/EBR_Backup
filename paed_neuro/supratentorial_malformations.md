# Supratentorial Malformations

## Abnormalities of Neuronal / Grey Matter development. 

Mature cerebral cortex has 6 layers. 
Cells start in *germinal matrix* of cerebral cortex along the margins of the lateral ventricles in 3 stages:
1. Neuronal proliferation = cells form in the germinal matrix.
2. Neuronal migration = cells move to the periphery. 
3. Neuronal organization = cells form normal cortex.  

### Abnormalities of Neuronal Proliferation.

#### 1) Hemimegalencephaly

S+S: Seizures, mostly severe.  
Path: Hamartomatous / dysplastic overgrowth of whole of one cerebral hemisphere.  
Rad: 
-	Increase in size of one hemi and skull
-	Venticle is LARGER on affected side.
-	^^ Blood flow -> More rapid myelination. 
-	Heterotopia / Polymicrogyria  

Variants: Can affect only part of a hemisphere and thus cross over with FCD.  

#### 2) Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD)  
S+S: Seizures, incidental, Delayed development.  

**Type I**  
Path: Focal abnormal proliferation of abnormal cells.
Rad: Best seen on T1.  
- Type Ia: Abnormal Radial Lamination 
- Type Ib: Abnormal Tangential Lamination  
- Type Ic: Both.
