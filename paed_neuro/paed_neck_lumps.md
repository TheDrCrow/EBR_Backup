# Neck lumps in Children 

[^Bansal2018] is good review and in Papers. 
[^McQueen2021]:McQueen A, Head & Neck US, SPIN 2021.
[^Bansal2018]:Bansal A et al, US of Pediatric Superficial Mass of the Head & Neck, RadioGraphics 2018; 38:1239-1236. https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2018170165. Papers+

## Lymph Nodes [^McQueen2021]

SCM covers the majority of nodes thus not felt.  
- Therefore Level V are frequently referred even when normal as superficial.   
Level IIB nodes are most likely to be enlarged due to the drainage of throat.
  - Peaks of presentation in pre-school/early school and then in Teens.  
Defines 'Reactive' as normal morpho but with high flow, normal pattern.

### 1. Lymphadenitis 

Rad : "*Inflammatory fat wrap*" = Echogenic thickening around nodes. Et al.  
DD: Cat Scratch fever, fungi, Mononucleosis, AIDS, Sarcoid, Histiocytosis et al [^Bansal2018]

> Mycobacterial = Well child with large, round nodes which are less hot / vascular than expected and often with extension to skin.  

### 2. Lymphoma 
CF: Feel hard, round, non-mobile but painless.
Rad: Round, hypoechoic, clustered nodes.  
    Hypervascular (vascular index might help in future)

### 3. Papillary Thyroid Ca.
The only other commonish malignancy in nodes in kids.  
Rad: Microcalcification +/- cystic change.  
NB = Look at thyroid as well. 

## Congenital Lesions   
= Mostly **Cysts** and diagnosable by *Location, Location, Location*.[^McQueen2021]

### 1. Thyroglossal Cysts.
Anat: Thyroglossal Duct= Back of Tongue -> *Over* Hyoid -> lower neck.
Path: Persistence of part of duct = 
    1) Ectopic Thyroid and/or
    2) Thyroglossal duct cyst 
   So, always check the thyroid to ensure it is there.   
Hyoid Bone is key = 
 -20% Suprahyoid 
 -30% @ Hyoid 
 -50% Infrahyoid  
   
RAD: 
 -Avascular, mid/off mid cyst. ( infra hyoid often embed in strap muscles )
 -Often pseudosolid.
 -**Look for Track** as the diffs don't have this but will be small and subtle.
RX: Small risk of malignant degeneration into Pap Thryoid which can be tricky to diff from normal tissue. Also risks of infection etc  
--SISTRUNK Procedure: En-block removal of thyroglossal cyst & duct remnant with central part of hyoid bone.   

DD: Epidermoid / Dermoid   
Does not have track. US is best at diff

### 2. Branchial Cleft Cysts 

Type | Freq | Anatomy | Presentation |  
:---|:---:|:---|:---|
1st | 8% | EAC => Angle of Mandible | Cyst on top of Parotid | 
2nd | 90-95% | Faucial Tonsil => Low ant. Neck | Cyst anterior to SCM, anterolateral to Carotid space |
3rd | <1% | Upper Post Triangle => Ant lower neck | Cyst medial to SCM, posterior to Carotid space 
4th | 1%  | Pyriform fossa => Thru Thyrohyoid membrane => Mediastinum | Cyst / Collection in/around the upper thyroid | 

> Also 2nd cleft can rarely fistulate and be open all / most of the way with saliva coming out. 

### 3. Vascular Malformations 

Generally divided into LOW & HIGH flow lesions.
In H&N 

#### Lymphatic  
75% of all are in H&N. 
CF: <2yr old, Soft cyst in posterior triangle.
RAD: Lobulated, thin-walled, micro (<2mm) vs macro cyst.
 -High T2, often Fluid-Fluid levels (= slow flow). 
 -Transpatial (as lymph channels)  

#### Venous 
45% of all are in H&N 
CF: Teen/YP, ^^Exercise/Valsalva, compressible.
RAD: Septated, High T2 
 -PHLEBOLITHS

#### Infantile Haemangioma  
60% of all are in H&N. 
Rarely seen at birth but 90% become visible in first month.
EPID: 1% of newborn but 12% at 1y age.
NH: Grow in 1st yr, tend to regress 1-3ys. 
RAD: US = Discrete masses.
 -High-velocity arterial and low-resistance venous waveforms.
