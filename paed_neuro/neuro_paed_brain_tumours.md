Everything you know had been thrown in the air by the WHO Classification of Tumours of the CNS. 2021 [^Louis2021] which 
    - Moves to a genetic and protein analysis > position, histo, IHC etc. 
    - Describes itself as a 'hybrid taxonomy' with some tumours strongly defined by several biological markers and others by one or none and relying on histo etc. 

Built upon a series of committees referred to as cIMPACT-NOW
> Consortium to Inform Molecular & Practical Approaches to CNS Tumour Taxonomy. 

SPIN [^Mankad2021] states that this will require 're-basing' of historical tumour cohorts as so many cases have now moved to other categories and new categories are being formed.  
Several types and sub-types are felt to be unlikely to remain as they are, though.  
Contentious and is based entirely on the histo with no input from Radiology.
