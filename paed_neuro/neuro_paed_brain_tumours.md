# Paediatric Brain Tumours. 

Everything you know had been thrown in the air by the WHO Classification of Tumours of the CNS. 2021 [^Louis_2021] which 
    - Moves to a genetic and protein analysis > position, histo, IHC etc. 
    - Describes itself as a 'hybrid taxonomy' with some tumours strongly defined by several biological markers and others by one or none and relying on histo etc. 

Built upon a series of committees referred to as cIMPACT-NOW
> Consortium to Inform Molecular & Practical Approaches to CNS Tumour Taxonomy. 

SPIN [^Mankad_2021] states that this will require 're-basing' of historical tumour cohorts as so many cases have now moved to other categories and new categories are being formed.  
Several types and sub-types are felt to be unlikely to remain as they are, though.  
Contentious and is based entirely on the histo with no input from Radiology.

## Posterior Fossa Predominant Tumours [^Choudri_2017] [^Louis_2021] [^Brandao_2016]  

30% of all Brain tumours in <14yr.
Read: [^Brandao_2016] for Imaging. 

Name | Demographics | Path | Appearance | T1, T2, ADC | Enhancement | Notes | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
**Pilocytic Astrocytoma** (PA) | Common  | JPA = Grade 1. Focal & Low risk for mets or further malignant degeneration | Cystic lesion with nodule. Little oedema. Solid looking in cord / deep with intermediate T2.| T2=High in nodule. ADC=High(1500)in nodule. | Nodule ++ (still low grade) | Total resection can be curative. |
**Ependymoma** | Common | Usually Grade 2. Mostly extra-axial in infratentorial & intra-axial in supra. | 'Toothpaste' spread. IV Ventricle => Foramina of Luschka. Mixed,cyst,solid,calcification,haemorrhage 0/+ oedema.| T2=Hetero. ADC between Medullo & PA | 0/+. | Surgical resection is key. Adj RT. Not chemo. | 
**Medulloblastoma** (MB) | 2M:F, 5-7yrs median. 80% pre-10yo.Young kids = IV ventricle. Older Teens/YP = Intracerebellar  | Embryonal Tumours. High Grade. SHH and WNT activation and ***new*** *TP53*. Highly Cellular | Roof of IV Ventricle => Hydrocephalus. Drop mets and mets to CNS. | CT=High Atn. T1=Iso. T2=Low/Int+Hetero.ADC=Low (DD: anaplastic ependymoma, AT/RT). | ++/+++, Hetero. | Intra-axial variant was = Desmoplastic Nodular Medulloblastoma |

ADC /Perfusion / Spectro to spot high grade regions | 0 / of small focal+ | Was = Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) 


### Pilocytic Astrocytoma. 

### Ependymoma  

WHO 2021 has expanded into a family of tumours based on Histopath, molecular
features & anatomic site. 
Long-standing controversy about grading Ependymomas. But still allowed 2 or 3.  

Anatomically divided into Supratentorial, Posterior Fossa and Spinal with
Myxopapillary and Subependymoma being the other 2 types.   
- The Posterior Fossa group are typed as:
    - Posterior Fossa Ependymoma
        - for when molecular analysis fails / is negative etc.
    - Posterior Fossa Ependymoma, group PFA.
    - Posterior Fossa Ependymoma, group PFB.
This must be something to do with / without hypermethylated phenotype (CIMP) 


### Medulloblastoma 

Have become a complex group of tumours with WHO 2021 changing again. 
Variety of embryonal originator cells.  
SHH and WNT (wingless) are both signalling pathways. 
Subgroups have come about via methylation and transcriptome profiling.

#### Medulloblastomas 
- Medulloblastomas, molecularly defined.
    - Medulloblastoma, WNT-activated 
    - Medulloblastoma, SHH-activated & *TP53-wildtype*
        - Now 4 subgroups = SHH-1, SHH-2 etc but alpha etc used elsewhere.
        - Diff chemo responsiveness & outcomes.
    - Medulloblastoma, SHH-activated & *TP53-mutant*
        - as above ( I think SHHalpha is this group?) 
    - Medulloblastoma, non-WNT/non-SHH
        - Was the 'Group 3 & 4' in the 2016 WHO.
        - Now 8 subgroups 
- Medulloblastomas, histologically defined.
        - [ 2016 had 4 morpho patterns, each separate now all combined ]
        - [ Classic, Desmoplastic/Nodular, MB with Extensive Nodularity(MBEN) &
            Large cell/Anaplastic ] 
        - But molecularly defined MB have associations with morpho patterns. 
        - Desmoplastic/Nodular & MBENs == SHH-1 and SHH-2. 
        - WNT-activated == Classic morphology.
        - Large Cell / Anaplastic == SHH-3  

**SHH(Sonic Hedgehog) Medulloblastoma**
- 30% of all MBs, Intermediate prognosis. 
- Dichotomous Age with spikes in <4yo and >16yo. 
- Mostly in the hemispheres and not in midline.
- Mostly Desmoplastic morphology. 

**WNT(Wingless) Medulloblastomas**
- 10%, Best prognosis = OS of 90% and thus most studied.
- Age: Spike in 10-12yo. 
- Mostly in middle cerebellar peduncle or CPA. 
- Classic histology/morphology. Rarely Large cell / anaplastic but retain good
    prognosis.  

**non-WNT/non-SHH** 
- includes the 'Group 3' = 25%, worse prognosis. 
- Age: Children not adults. MYC amplification.
- Mostly rather ill-defined on imagin. 
- Classic or Large cell/anaplastic morpho

**THINK** Germline mutations.
1. Basal Cell Naevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome) 
    - AD. 10% get MBs. 
    - Falcine Calcification = is a marker!! 
2. Turcot Syndrome 
    - Familial colonic polyposis.
    - High Inc of CNS tumours esp MB & Glioma. 
3. Li-Fraumeni 
    - Have mutations in *p53* tumour suppressor gene. 
    - Lots of sarcomas but 10% MB. 


### Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumour. 

### Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.   
Prognosis is related to position.  
    - Midbrain = 80% at 5ys.
    - Pontine = 20% at 5 yrs
and to Extension 
    - Diffuse = 20% at 5ys 
    - Focal = 80% at 5ys.

H3-K27M =Gene for the Histone H3.
