# Paediatric Brain Tumours. 

Everything you know had been thrown in the air by the WHO Classification of Tumours of the CNS. 2021 [^Louis_2021] which 
    - Moves to a genetic and protein analysis > position, histo, IHC etc. 
    - Describes itself as a 'hybrid taxonomy' with some tumours strongly defined by several biological markers and others by one or none and relying on histo etc. 

Built upon a series of committees referred to as cIMPACT-NOW
> Consortium to Inform Molecular & Practical Approaches to CNS Tumour Taxonomy. 

SPIN [^Mankad_2021] states that this will require 're-basing' of historical tumour cohorts as so many cases have now moved to other categories and new categories are being formed.  
Several types and sub-types are felt to be unlikely to remain as they are, though.  
Contentious and is based entirely on the histo with no input from Radiology.

Name | Demo | Path | Appearance | T1, T2, ADC | Enhancement | Notes | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PXA) | Common  | JPA = Grade 1. Focal & Low risk for mets or further malignant degeneration | Cystic lesion with nodule. Little oedema. Solid looking in cord / deep.| ADC often high (1500) in nodule. | Nodule enhances (still low grade) | Total resection can be curative.
