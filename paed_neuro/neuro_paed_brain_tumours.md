# Paediatric Brain Tumours. 

Everything you know had been thrown in the air by the WHO Classification of Tumours of the CNS. 2021 [^Louis_2021] which 
    - Moves to a genetic and protein analysis > position, histo, IHC etc. 
    - Describes itself as a 'hybrid taxonomy' with some tumours strongly defined by several biological markers and others by one or none and relying on histo etc. 

Built upon a series of committees referred to as cIMPACT-NOW
> Consortium to Inform Molecular & Practical Approaches to CNS Tumour Taxonomy. 

SPIN [^Mankad_2021] states that this will require 're-basing' of historical tumour cohorts as so many cases have now moved to other categories and new categories are being formed.  
Several types and sub-types are felt to be unlikely to remain as they are, though.  
Contentious and is based entirely on the histo with no input from Radiology.

## Posterior Fossa Predominant Tumours [^Choudri_2017] [^Louis_2021]   
30% of all Brain tumours in <14yr.

Name | Demo | Path | Appearance | T1, T2, ADC | Enhancement | Notes | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
**Pilocytic Astrocytoma** (PA) | Common  | JPA = Grade 1. Focal & Low risk for mets or further malignant degeneration | Cystic lesion with nodule. Little oedema. Solid looking in cord / deep with intermediate T2.| ADC often high (1500) in nodule. | Nodule ++ (still low grade) | Total resection can be curative. |
**Ependymoma** | Common | Usually low-grade. Mostly extra-axial in infratentorial & intra-axial in supra. | 'Toothpaste' spread. IV Ventricle => Foramina of Luschka. 0/+ oedema.| Int, homo T2. ADC between Medullo & PXA | 0/+. | Surgical resection is key. Adj RT. Not chemo. | 
**Medulloblastoma** (MB) | 2M:F, 5-7yrs median. 80% pre-10yo.Young kids = IV ventricle. Older Teens/YP = Intracerebellar  | Embryonal Tumours. High Grade. SHH and WNT activation and ***new*** *TP53*. | Roof of IV Ventricle => Hydrocephalus. Drop mets and mets to CNS. | Iso T1, Int, Hetero T2. Low ADC (DD: anaplastic ependymoma, AT/RT). | ++/+++, Hetero. | Intra-axial variant was = Desmoplastic Nodular Medulloblastoma | 
**Atypical Teratoid / Rhabdoid Tumour** (AT/RT) | Rare. <5ys | Embryonal. Aggressive. Highly cellular. | Can be in IV or intra-axial. Drop mets.| Similar to MB. |  Similar to MB. | | 
**Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3 K27-altered** | Uncommon | Variable grade. Often regions of high grade. | Diffuse enlargement of Pons / brainstem. Encases Basilar A. | High, hetero T2.  ADC /Perfusion / Spectro to spot high grade regions | | Was = Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)
