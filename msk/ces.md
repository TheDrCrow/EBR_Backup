# Cauda Equina Syndrome

## Classifications & Definitions 

#### A Clinical One 

**Idealised Concept** [^1]. But initial definitions in SBNS 2009 Guidelines. 

Name | Acronym | Clinical Features | Outcomes | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
CES-Suspected | CESS | Bilateral Radiculopathy AND/OR  subjective sphincter problems AND/OR  subjective perineal sensory changes BUT NO objective evidence of CES. | 85% Free of sciatica. Normal bladder, bowel & sexual function |
CES-Incomplete | CESI | Subjective symptoms and objective signs of CES.  Voluntary control of micturition. | Normal/Social bladder & bowel function. Normal or reduced sexual function. |  
CES-Retention | CESR | Neurogenic retention of urine (Bladder paralysed and insensate) | Often paralysed, insensate bladder & bowel. Often need catheter and manual evacuation. No/reduced sexual function.  | 

Todd[^1] points out that a lot of S+S in the guidelines are actually signs of irreversible CES (White flags not Red Flags)  
Draws clear lines of operate before there are signs. 
- Definite red flags
  - Bilateral Radiculopathy.
  - Progressive neuro in legs. 
- Red flag or White flag 
  - Impaired perianal sensation 
  - Impaired anal tone 
  - Non-spec urinary disturbance 
- White Flag 
  - Urinary retention or incontinence 
  - Faecal incontinence. 
  - Perineal sensation.

But states '48-93%' of CESR can show improvement post op with some evidence for surgery within 12-72 hours.  
Very hawkish about doing lots of MR:
 > 'MR Imaging of the ? CES patient is part of triage and should be performed at the DGH, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, prior to discussion with the Regional Centre.'

 But, also quotes 'low' rates of CE compression confirmed on MR (14-33%!!) and non-specific nature of S+S means this work should be done in the DGH. 

### Clear Definition & Classifications have been [^2] 

Anatomically the CE is all the roots from the distal spinal cord from L1 to S5.  
Roots L1 to S1 are the legs and do not produce the clinical syndrome of 'CES'.  
> 'Cauda equina syndrome is historically used to describe the result of the dysfunction of S2 - S5'
