# Cauda Equina Syndrome

## Classifications & Definitions 

#### A Clinical One 

**Idealised Concept** [^1]. But initial definitions in SBNS 2009 Guidelines. 

Name | Acronym | Clinical Features | Outcomes | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
CES-Suspected | CESS | Bilateral Radiculopathy AND/OR  subjective sphincter problems AND/OR  subjective perineal sensory changes BUT NO objective evidence of CES. | 85% Free of sciatica. Normal bladder, bowel & sexual function |
CES-Incomplete | CESI | Subjective symptoms and objective signs of CES.  Voluntary control of micturition. | Normal/Social bladder & bowel function. Normal or reduced sexual function. |  
CES-Retention | CESR | Neurogenic retention of urine (Bladder paralysed and insensate) | Often paralysed, insensate bladder & bowel. Often need catheter and manual evacuation. No/reduced sexual function.  | 

Todd[^1] points out that a lot of S+S in the guidelines are actually signs of irreversible CES (White flags not Red Flags)  
Draws clear lines of operate before there are signs. 
- Definite red flags
  - Bilateral Radiculopathy.
  - Progressive neuro in legs. 
- Red flag or White flag 
  - Impaired perianal sensation 
  - Impaired anal tone 
  - Non-spec urinary disturbance 
- White Flag 
  - Urinary retention or incontinence 
  - Faecal incontinence. 
  - Perineal sensation. 
l
But states '48-93%' of CESR can show improvement post op with some evidence for surgery within 12-72 hours.  
Very hawkish about doing lots of MR:
 > 'MR Imaging of the ? CES patient is part of triage and should be performed at the DGH, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, prior to discussion with the Regional Centre.'

 But, also quotes 'low' rates of CE compression confirmed on MR (14-33%!!) and non-specific nature of S+S means this work should be done in the DGH. 

### Clear Definition & Classifications have been [^2] 

Lavy et al [^2] reviewed 21ys of papers to 2021. n=212.  
To find Definition & Classification of CES.  
Medicolegal issues are mentioned prominently.  
Accept that definitions are uncertain and that there is a role and need for a clinical judgement. 

Anatomically the CE is all the roots from the distal spinal cord from L1 to S5.  
Roots L1 to S1 are the legs and do not produce the clinical syndrome of 'CES'.  
> 'Cauda equina syndrome is historically used to describe the result of the dysfunction of S2 - S5'

Recommend: as a practical definition. 
> Cauda equina syndrome is a clinical diagnosis resulting from dysfunction of one or more of the sacral nerve roots S2 and below. One or more of the following symptoms or signs must be present:  
> - Bladder and/or bowel dysfunction. 
> - Reduced sensation in the saddle area. 
> - Sexual dysfunction. 
> Back and leg pain, and lower limb motor or sensory changes are often present but are not essential to the diagnosis.  
> Nerve root compression is the commonest cause and MRI scanning is usually needed for confirmation.  

**Other Classifications**  

By presentation. *Tandon & Sankaran*
| Type | Description | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
Type 1 | Rapid onset of CES symptoms with no past history of back problems | Rare in Litigation.
Type 2 | Acute bladder / CES symptoms with a history of back pain and sciatica. | Majority in Litigation. 
Type 3 | Longstanding back problems and gradually progressive CES often with spinal stenosis | "usually non-urgent". Elderly, more tolerant of reduction in bladder/bowel/sexual function.
