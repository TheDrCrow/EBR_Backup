### Mid Tibial Fractures 

#### CT 
Is useful as significant incidence of radiographic occult fractures extending to the pilon. [^1]
 - Posterior malleolar fractures in 70% of spiral tibial shaft.
 - 50% of these fractures were missed on radiographs.  

And, there is debate about need to stabilise this fragment which separates out the posterior malleolus. [^1] 
 - Some say 25% of surface area -> ORIF.
 - Others based on stability & displacement.
