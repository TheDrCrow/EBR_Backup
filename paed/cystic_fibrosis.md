## Guidelines = NICE NG78 2017 [^1]

### 1.5 Annual and routine reviews
... *Radiology mentioned for Lungs, DIOS & Liver.*

1.6.4 Include the following at each annual review in relation to pulmonary assessment for people with cystic fibrosis:

- a clinical assessment, including a review of the clinical history and medicines adherence, and a physical examination, with measurement of weight and length or height

- a physiotherapy assessment

- measurement of oxygen saturation

- **a chest X-ray**

- blood tests, including white cell count, aspergillus serology and serum IgE

- taking respiratory secretion samples for microbiological investigations (including non-tuberculous mycobacteria)

- lung function testing (for example with spirometry, including FEV1, FVC, and FEF 25â€“75%) in adults, and in children and young people who can do this.
... 

1.6.7 Think about doing a **low-dose chest CT scan** for children with cystic fibrosis who have not had a chest CT scan before, to detect features that other tests (such as a plain chest X-ray) would miss (for example early bronchiectasis).

1.6.8 Think about doing a **chest X-ray** for people with cystic fibrosis during or after treatment for an exacerbation of lung disease (taking account of severity), if:

- the exacerbation does not respond to treatment or

- a **chest X-ray** before treatment showed new radiological abnormalities.

### 1.7 Other monitoring, assessment and management. 

... 

#### Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome (DIOS)

1.7.8 Be aware that a variety of conditions can cause acute abdominal pain and resemble distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in people with cystic fibrosis, for example:

- constipation

- appendicitis

- intussusception

- cholecystitis.

1.7.9 Suspect distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in people with cystic fibrosis who have an acute onset of peri-umbilical or right lower quadrant abdominal pain and any of the following:

- a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant

- faecal loading in the right lower quadrant on a **plain abdominal X-ray**, especially if associated with small intestine air-fluid levels

- clinical features of partial or complete intestinal obstruction, such as vomiting (especially bilious) and abdominal distension.

1.7.10 For people who have an acute onset of peri-umbilical abdominal pain but no other clinical or radiological features of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, **consider further imaging**, for example with an:

- **abdominal ultrasound scan** or

- **abdominal CT scan**.

... *Says manage in specialist centre with Gastrograffin as first line*

#### Liver Disease 

1.7.17 Perform a clinical assessment and liver function blood tests at the annual review for people with cystic fibrosis.

1.7.18 If liver function blood tests are **abnormal**, perform a **liver ultrasound** scan and consider ursodeoxycholic acid treatment.

... Other stuff about referring on. 

### BUT 

#### We are in the RBH/Kings/Bton Sphere of Influence 

RBH Guidelines are [here](https://www.rbht.nhs.uk/sites/nhs/files/Cystic%20fibrosis%20guidelines/CF%20G%202020/7.pdf) [^2]

They state: 
"Routine annual assessment ultrasound on alternate years from aged 5 years and above. It will be repeated in 1 year if abnormal."  

But then state that it includes ISHAK measure of fibrosis despite not having any validation in paeds and is reported as a 'standardised manner'.
