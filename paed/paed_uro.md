### UTI 

--- 

### Cryptorchidism [^Uroweb2021]

3% of full-term infants. 20% of prems. 
1% of Full-term infants at 1y have an undescended testis.
- 30% of cases are bilateral. Strong association with DSD.

#### Classification & Phrases 

***Undescended Testis*** = On the normal path but stopped usual descent.  
***Ectopic Testis*** = Off the normal path & outside scrotum.
- Most common is Superficial Inguinal Pouch, Others are femoral, perineal, pubic, penile or contralateral. 
- Almost all need an op.  
***Retractile Testis*** = Have descended normally then can be found in suprascrotal positions due to overactive cremasteric reflex.
- Will be manipulable easily into normal position & usually normal testis. 
- 1/3 will ascend and not come down. Thus, need monitoring. 

#### Investigation. 

'... use of **imaging** ... is limited and only for specific scenarios eg identification of Mullerian structures in a ? DSD.'  
This is because of limited sensitivity in abdomen and elsewhere. And limited specificity.  

#### Managment. 
At 6m as low probability of resolution later.  
Complete treatments by 12- 18mo as from this age there is loss of Germ & Leydig cells.  
Aims of treatment are adult hormone production, speramtogenesis and risk of malignancy.

### Scrotal Swelling / Hydrocele / Hernia. [^Uroweb2021]

***Primary Hydrocele*** <= Patent Processus Vaginalis.  
Persistent processus forms 'communicating hydroceles' 
But, processus is patent in approx 20% of Adults! 

#### Diagnosis. 
'... diagnosed with history-taking and physical investigation.'
- **History**
- - Variability with time and ambulation.
- **Physical**
- - Transillumination.  

**Ultrasound** for '... any doubts about the character of an intrascrotal mass.'

#### Treatment. 
Under 12m leave alone as many resolve. Incarceration = RARE though a hernia on US is normally an indication for surgery. 
Over 12m debatable whether surgery or no surgery as no evidence simple hydrocele will damage the testis and NH is not clear over 2ys old.   

Later onset hydroceles, suggesting secondary, then leave for 6 to 9 months as 75% resolve.

### Antenatal Hydronephrosis. [^UTD2014]

Based on consensus from ACR, AIUM, ASPN, SFU, SPU, SRU and others. 

Defined both 'A' = antenatal findings and management *and*
'P' = postnatal findings and management. 

#### Postnatal. 
- For >48hrs post delivery.  

| Risk Level | APRPD | Calyceal Dilatation | Parenchyma | Ureters | Bladder | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| LOW = 'UTD P1' | **10- <15mm** | **Central only**. | Normal Thickness & Appearance. | Normal | Normal | 
| INTERMEDIATE = 'UTD P2' | **>=15mm** | Central &/or **Peripheral** | Normal Thickness or Appearance | **Abnormal** | Normal | 
| HIGH = 'UTD P3' | >=15mm | Central &/or Peripheral | **Abnormal Thickness or Appearance**. | Abnormal | **Abnormal** | 


##### Management. 

Level | Follow Up US | MCUG | Abx | MAG3 / Functional Scan |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| UTD P1 | 1 to 6 months. | *Discretion of clinician* | *Discretion of clinician* | Not recommended. |
UTD P2 | 1 to 3 months | *Discretion of clinician*  | *Discretion of clinician*| *Discretion of clinician* | 
UTD P3 | 1 month | Recommended | Recommended | *Discretion of clinician* |
