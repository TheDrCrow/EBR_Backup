## **Guidelines**

### NICE Peripheral Arterial Disease. CG147 2012, 2020 [^NICE2012]  
[^NICE2012]: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg147/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosis  

**1.3 Diagnosis**  

Assessment includes: 
  1) Ask about presence & severity of possible symptoms of intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia.   
  2) Examine legs for signs of critical limb ischaemia, ie arterial ulceration.  
  3) Examine Femoral , Popliteal & foot pulses.
  4) Measure Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI). Can be falsely normal in DM.
  $$ 
    ABPI = Highest Ankle Pressure / Highest Arm Pressure. 
  $$  

**1.4 Imaging for Revascularization** 

1.4.1
  > Offer duplex ultrasound as first‑line imaging to all people with peripheral arterial disease for whom revascularisation is being considered.   

1.4.2 
  > Offer contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance angiography to people with peripheral arterial disease who need further imaging (after duplex ultrasound) before considering revascularisation. [2012]  

1.4.3 
  > Offer computed tomography angiography to people with peripheral arterial disease who need further imaging (after duplex ultrasound) if contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is contraindicated or not tolerated. [2012]  

**1.5 Management of Intermittent Claudication**  

Essentially is a Supervised Exercise programme and modification of risk factors for 3 months.  
Angioplasty is only done if this has failed and a MRA/CTA at this time shows a suitable lesion. 

**1.6 Management of Critical Limb Ischaemia**  

Needs an MDM decision.  
Plan for revascularisation or amputation.
