## Malignant pleural Effusion and CT 

Review Article from Oxford in 2017 [^1]

|Sign | Sensitivity | Average | Specificity | Mean |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|  
Nodular Pleural Thickening | 18-53% | 30% | 87-100% | 95% |
Mediastinal Pleural Thickening | 14-74% | 50% | 68-97% | 92% |
Parietal thickening >1cm | 7-47% | 25% | 64-98% | 90% |
Circumferential thickening | 7-54% | 30% | 63-100% | 90% | 

But circumferential thickening is less specific if there is a pleural effusion.
